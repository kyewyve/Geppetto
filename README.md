## Philosophy

The introduction of premium skins with prohibitive pricing (such as exclusive skins costing the equivalent of multiple months' wages in some regions) has created a significant barrier for many players.

> I believe that gaming culture should be inclusive and accessible, and not just a privilege for those who can afford it.

The skins in this repository are distributed for free and adapted by one person.

If you see somewhere that someone is offering my versions for X amount, most likely they are just scammers.

1. **Arcane Fractured Jinx**
2. **Immortalized Legend Ahri**
3. **Immortalized Legend Kai'Sa**

>Gradually, the number of "complex" skins will expand. Remember, I'm the only one working on these versions, and I have my own job, my own personal life, and my own hobbies.
